text.Porsche911Carrera=So far we've driven the new 992 generation of Porsche's 911 in both rear-driven Carrera S and four-wheel-drive Carrera 4S guises, the former only on track, and yet both early tests suggested that this eighth-generation, rear-engined sporting hero is every inch as great a driver's car as the 991 it's replacing this year - and, if anything, stands ready to take the game away from its rivals.
text.JaguarFType=The car falls short of being truly exceptional - it has too many imperfections and shortcomings for that. On usability, it comes up short next to plenty of sports cars, having only two seats, offering slightly cramped accommodation even for two, and limited boot space in convertible forms. And yet, in multi-cylinder engine guises particularly, it has performance and handling dynamism every bit as boisterous as its throaty, vivacious soul - and a driving experience to savour.
text.LotusEvora=At the time of its introduction, the car brought plenty of qualities to embrace but also flaws to regret. Today, it retains a chassis and steering system that both truly deserve top billing. Few sports cars have such immersive, positive steering, or a ride and handling compromise so suited to life on British roads.
text.BMWi8=The i8 is one of the most compelling and unusual sports cars we've tested in years, not only because of its fascinating plug-in hybrid powertrain, its appealing driving experience and its otherworldly design, but also because of how exquisitely finished it feels as a product - both inside and outside - and how easy it would be to live with.
text.NissanGTR=However long in the tooth he has become, "Godzilla" is in rude health. If out-and-out real-world, any-condition speed is what you crave from your sports car, nothing does it better below 100k dollars than Nissan's self-identified "world's fastest brick" - the incredible, indefatigable GT-R.
text.LexusLC=As a keen driver, you feel inclined to make a case for the LC. It has a superbly charismatic and likeable V8 engine, and balanced, spry, involving handling makes it feel, at times, more of a natural rival for a Jaguar F-Type or a Porsche 911 than the mix of two- and four-door sporting grand tourers that Lexus identifies as its true opponents. Hence the car's inclusion here.
